# Mintlify Starter Kit: Your Quest for Epic Docs Begins Here!

So, you've stumbled upon the legendary Mintlify Starter Kit. Your quest, should you choose to accept it, is to create documentation so magnificent, so breathtaking, that bards will sing songs of it for centuries to come.

## Your Epic Journey Awaits

First things first, you'll need to arm yourself. No, not with a sword and shield, but with code! Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mintlify/starter.git
```

### The Tools of the Trade

Before you can build your masterpiece, you'll need the right tools. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed. They're like the hammer and anvil of the modern-day wordsmith.

### The Magic Words

Next, you'll need to learn the ancient incantation to summon the Mintlify CLI. Utter these words into your terminal:

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

### Gaze Into the Crystal Ball

Now, it's time to see your creation come to life. Navigate to the root of your documentation (where the mystical `docs.json` scroll is kept) and chant the following:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A portal will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`, allowing you to gaze upon your documentation in all its glory.

## Make It Your Own

This is your kingdom, your domain, your... well, you get the idea. Make it your own!

*   **`docs.json`**: This is your royal decree. Change the name of your kingdom, its colors, and the layout of your castle.
*   **`.mdx` files**: These are your scrolls. Fill them with tales of your adventures, your triumphs, and your... API endpoints.
*   **`images/` and `logo/`**: These are your banners and sigils. Fly them high and proud!

## Unleash Your Creation Upon the World

When your masterpiece is complete, it's time to share it with the world. The Mintlify GitHub app will act as your royal messenger, delivering your documentation to the far corners of the internet. You can summon the app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

Once the app is installed, your documentation will be automatically updated every time you push changes to your repository. It's like magic, but with more code.
